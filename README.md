The SIS is an application developed using Core Java that operates in a console-based environment. The system allows users to efficiently handle student data, including features such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records. Every student entry contains personal information like name, age, grade, and student ID.

Create a new student entry by adding basic information.  Display Student: Show details of an individual student or all students.
Revise Student: Edit information of a current student. Remove Student: Erase a student's information from the database.
Stack of technologies : Java
Themes: Object-based Programming, Reading/Writing Files, Error Management
File storage for long-lasting student records.

Potential Improvements include a search feature that allows users to search by student ID or name. Incorporate a database to enhance data administration.
This project acts as an excellent educational resource for students to grasp Core Java principles, such as file management and Object-Oriented Programming. It has the potential to be expanded into more intricate systems for educational institutions.
